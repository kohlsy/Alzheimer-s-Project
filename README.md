# Alzheimer's Detection

Developed novel Graph convolutional network to predict Alzheimerâ€™s disease in patients based on numerous clinical parameters such as age, socioeconomic status (SES), years of education, Atlas Scaling Factor (AFS), and intracranial volume of the brain. Promising results were obtained from the optimized model, with 94.2% accuracy, 0.98 precision, 0.89 recall, and 0.93 F1-score
